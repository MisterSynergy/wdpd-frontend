      <h2>About patrol</h2>
      <p>“Patrol” is a MediaWiki function that serves as a tool to coordinate countervandalism activities.</p>
      <p>Edits in <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/" title="Wikidata homepage">Wikidata</a> by non-registered users (“IPs”) or newcomers with fewer than four days of participation and 50 edits are being marked with a “patrol” flag in the database for a period of 30 days. This should encourage experienced users to review these edits, as these edits are being highlighted in the Wikidata interface and some countervandalism tools. Most of the edits requiring “patrol” are fine; however, some new editors have difficulties to make acceptable edits due to a lack of experience, and there are also occasional “vandals” who make edits with bad faith that are potentially damaging to Wikidata’s reputation. The patrol process predominantly aims to remove vandalism as quickly as possible from the Wikidata project, and to remove good edits from the unpatrolled changes review workflow.</p>
      <p>A difficulty in Wikidata’s patrol process is that the edits to patrol are usually relatively “atomic” in nature, i.e. they come without much context that would help to identify them as good-faith or bad-faith. The multilingual nature of the Wikidata project also exposes editors to edits in all sorts of languages. It is therefore advisable to filter recent changes by criteria that make it easier to patrol efficiently. Useful patrol strategies are outlined below.</p>
      <p>In Wikidata, all users with “autoconfirmed” right can actively patrol unpatrolled contributions, and their own contributions are automatically patrolled. Further information about patrol can be found <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Help:Patrolled_edits" title="Help:Patrolled_edits at mediawiki.org">at mediawiki.org</a> and <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Patrol" title="Wikidata:Patrol in Wikidata">in Wikidata itself</a> (draft page).</p>
      <h2>Make use of additional patrolling tools</h2>
      <p>The basic Mediawiki software that serves Wikidata provides only a few rather inefficient patrolling opportunities in the default web user interface. In order to patrol efficiently, you should set up your account to use a couple of additional tools that nicely integrate into the user interface. We start with a selection of useful Javascript additions to your account:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The “Mark as patrolled” gadget from <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-gadgets" title="Wikidata gadgets preferences">your Wikidata gadgets preferences</a></li>
        <li>The “Request Deletion” gadget from <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-gadgets" title="Wikidata gadgets preferences">your Wikidata gadgets preferences</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Mat%C4%9Bj_Such%C3%A1nek/patrolRevisions.js" title="patrolRevisions.js by User:Matěj Suchánek">patrolRevisions.js</a>, to be installed in <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:MyPage/common.js" title="your common.js page">your common.js page at Wikidata</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Yair_rand/DiffLists.js" title="DiffLists.js by User:Yair_rand">DiffLists.js</a>, to be installed in <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:MyPage/common.js" title="your common.js page">your common.js page at Wikidata</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Besides this, you can use the following tools on <a href="https://www.toolforge.org/" title="Wikimedia Toolforge">Wikimedia Toolforge</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://pltools.toolforge.org/rech/" title="reCh by User:Pasleim">reCh</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://wdvd.toolforge.org/index.php" title="Wikidata vandalism dashboard by User:Ladsgroup">Wikidata vandalism dashboard</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://speedpatrolling.toolforge.org/" title="Speedpatrolling by User:Lucas Werkmeister">Speedpatrolling</a></li>
        <li>There are a couple of other recent changes filter tools, but most of them do not seem to be adapted to Wikidata’s filter needs.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="strategies">Patrolling strategies</h2>
      <p>For efficient patrolling, it is useful to concentrate on one of these (or other) tasks:</p>
      <h3 class="strategies">Real-time recent changes patrolling</h3>
      <p>You can patrol changes nearly in real-time using <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges" title="Special:RecentChanges on Wikidata" target="_blank">Special:RecentChanges</a> on Wikidata with tag and filter options. An alternative is to use one of the plenty real-time recent changes tools, however some of them are not particularly adapted for Wikidata. Here is a (potentially incomplete) list: <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:YMS/ORC" title="ORC tool" target="_blank">ORC</a>, <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Huggle" title="Huggle" target="_blank">Huggle</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Twinkle" title="Twinkle tool" target="_blank">Twinkle</a>, <a href="https://raun.toolforge.org/?language=www&project=wikidata" title="raun tool" target="_blank">raun</a>, <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Krinkle/Tools/Real-Time_Recent_Changes" title="Real-Time Recent Changes" target="_blank">RTRC</a>, <a href="https://swviewer.toolforge.org/" title="SWViewer tool" target="_blank">SWViewer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:STiki" title="STiki" target="_blank">STiki</a>, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:LiveRC/Documentation/en" title="LiveRC tool" target="_blank">LiveRC</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Henna/VF" title="Vandal Fighter tool" target="_blank">Vandal Fighter</a>.</p>
      <p>The aim with this strategy is to skim the blatant vandalism and to remove it immediately.</p>
      <h3 class="strategies">Language or project based patrolling</h3>
      <p>Quite a lot of changes require language skills to patrol them. You can use tools such as <a href="https://pltools.toolforge.org/rech/" title="reCh tool" target="_blank">reCh</a>, <a href="https://wdvd.toolforge.org/index.php" title="WDVD tool" target="_blank">WDVD</a> or <a href="https://speedpatrolling.toolforge.org/" title="Speedpatrolling" target="_blank">Speedpatrolling</a> to patrol changes in a given language; as a side-task, you can also patrol unpatrolled sitelink changes on Wikimedia projects related to your language (use reCh for this task).</p>
      <p>The unpatrolled changes volume of all languages except English can be patrolled by a single user, although for the larger ones (Spanish, German, French, Italian, Russian), three to five regular patrollers would be better to keep the backlog short. For English, however, significantly more patrollers are required due to the volume of changes to be patrolled.</p>
      <p>This task does not need to be performed real-time, but clearing the backlog once a day would be a desirable goal.</p>
      <h3 class="strategies">User- and item-based patrolling</h3> 
      <p>Finally, a significant amount of unpatrolled changes is made by relatively few users, or in larger numbers on a single item. Unlike the single revision-based patrol strategies above, this approach aims to identify whether a given unregistered or new user edits with good faith (and the required skills), in order to batch patrol all of their changes. This tool provides some worklists for exactly this strategy. The assessment and patrolling itself, however, are being done onwiki using the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Mat%C4%9Bj_Such%C3%A1nek/patrolRevisions.js" title="patrolRevisions.js user script" target="_blank">patrolRevisions.js</a> user script. For an efficient assessment of a user’s contributions on their <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:Contributions" title="Special:Contributions on Wikidata" target="_blank">Special:Contributions</a> page, the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Yair_rand/DiffLists.js" title="DiffLists.js user script" target="_blank">DiffLists.js</a> user script is extremely helpful as it displays added and removed content at the same time.</p>
      <p>This task also does not need to be performed real-time.</p>
